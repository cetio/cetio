I am a hobbyist programmer primarily versed in systems languages and C#/.NET. I've been doing this little gig for about 6 years, and have as of late become very interested in low-level programming, reverse engineering, and the internals of C# (CoreCLR).

- **Languages:** C#, D, VB.NET, Java, C, C++
- **Technologies:** .NET, CoreCLR, x86, Z80, VEX
- **Web:** HTML, CSS (a wee bit)
- **Cryptography:** see [digests](https://github.com/cetio/tern/tree/main/source/tern/digest)
